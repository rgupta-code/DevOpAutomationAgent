## Emerging Trends
- **Long Context RAG**: Moving away from complex vector DBs for mid-sized projects, simply feeding entire files into 1M+ context models.
- **Multimodal SQL**: Using vision capabilities to analyze ERD diagrams and generate migration scripts.
- **Self-Correcting Agents**: Implementation of "Code Guard" style loops where models verify their own output via test execution.
